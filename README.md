Visual Analytics - Spring 2021

This is my repository with assignments related to the Spring 2021 module Visual Analytics

The repository includes the predefined assignments 1, 2, 3 and an undefined assignment. The code can be found in the folder src, while the data is uploaded in the folder "Data". Output is in the outputfolder


To run scripts within this repository, I recommend cloning the repository and installing relevant dependencies in a virtual ennvironment:

$ git clone https://github.com/aksroa/Visual-portfolio.git                                                  
$ cd Visual-portfolio                                                                                                                                                                
$ bash ./create_vision_venv.sh


If some of the libraries is not installed properly you can install these manually by running the following in the terminal:      

$ cd Visual-portfolio                                                                                                                                                         
$ source cv101/bin/activate                                                                                                                                   
$ pip install {module_name}                                                                                                                                           
$ deactivate

All the codes have been tested and runs on Windows 10
