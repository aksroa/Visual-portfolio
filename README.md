Visual Analytics - Spring 2021

This is my repository with assignments related to the Spring 2021 module Visual Analytics

The repository includes the predefined assignments 1, 2, 3 and an undefined assignment. The code can be found in the folder src, while the data is uploaded in the folder "Data". Output is in the outputfolder


Data: A folder to be used for sample datasets that we use in class.                                                                            
src: For Python scripts developed in class and as part of assignments.                                                                          
utils: Utility functions that are written by Ross, and which we have use in class.                                                              
Output: Outputs from the assignment


To run scripts within this repository, I recommend cloning the repository and installing relevant dependencies in a virtual ennvironment:

$ git clone https://github.com/aksroa/Visual-portfolio.git                                                  
$ cd Visual-portfolio                                                                                                                                                                
$ bash ./create_vision_venv.sh


If some of the libraries is not installed properly you can install these manually by running the following in the terminal:      

$ cd Visual-portfolio                                                                                                                                                         
$ source cv101/bin/activate                                                                                                                                   
$ pip install {module_name}                                                                                                                                           
$ deactivate

All the codes have been tested and runs on Windows 10
